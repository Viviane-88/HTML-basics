        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          A chocolate fountain is a device for serving chocolate fondue. Typical
          examples resemble a stepped cone, standing 2–4 feet tall with a crown
          at the top and stacked tiers over a basin at the bottom. The basin is
          heated to keep the chocolate in a liquid state so it can be pulled
          into a center cylinder then vertically transported to the top of the
          fountain by an Archimedes screw. From there it flows over the tiers
          creating a chocolate "waterfall" in which food items like strawberries
          or marshmallows can be dipped.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        "Chocolate fountain machines" were invented by Ben Brisman and
        popularized in 1991 by a Canadian company called Design &amp
        Realisation. They did not become very popular until Design &amp
        Realisation began displaying these fountains at the National Restaurant
        Show in Chicago, starting in the early 1990s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jay Harlan (an entrepreneur and former Marriott catering executive)
        collaborated with D &amp R to introduce the chocolate fountain to the
        U.S. hotel and resort industry. Jay Harlan's company (Buffet
        Enhancements International) began distributing the D &amp R fountain in
        the U.S. in 2001. It wasn't long after 2001 that Buffet Enhancements
        copied and improved the D &amp R fountain idea and began manufacturing
        their own American-made version.

      <h2>Types</h2>
      <p>
        Chocolate fountains can be categorized as commercial-use and
        personal-use. Commercial chocolate fountains can be categorized as Auger
        system and Pump system. Commercial chocolate fountains usually range in
        size from about 20" inches to 50" inches tall and are designed for use
        in professional environments such as catering. These fountains are
        normally constructed of food-grade stainless steel and, as such, are
        quite durable. Depending on the model, commercial chocolate fountains
        may hold as much as 35 pounds of chocolate. Originally, chocolate
        fountains consisted of multiple tiers that formed curtains of chocolate.
        New models on the market now have a 'cup' design, dropping chocolate
        from cup to cup which can be much more chocolate efficient than
        traditional models, and save quite a lot of money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Home chocolate fountains range in size up to about 19" tall. They are
        primarily made of plastic and may have some stainless steel components
        (although all-stainless models do exist) and are usually dishwasher
        safe. Home chocolate fountains normally hold 6 or fewer pounds of
        chocolate.
      </p>

      <h2>Chocolate</h2>
      <p>
        Melted chocolate is very temperamental, so rich couverture chocolate,
        which is high in cocoa butter, is commonly used to ensure consistent
        flow. If the cocoa butter content of the chocolate is too low, an
        additive must be mixed in to decrease viscosity. (Vegetable oil is most
        commonly used to do this.) But even couverture chocolate—unless
        specifically designed for fountains—often still requires an additive to
        make it flow smoothly. Because of this, it is highly recommended that
        chocolate formulated specifically for fountains be used to avoid the
        need for the addition of vegetable oil, as the oil gives a slimy, gritty
        taste and texture to the chocolate. Few chocolate fountains are capable
        of melting chocolate directly in the basin, so chocolate is typically
        melted in a microwave or double boiler before pouring it into the
        fountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fluid dynamics of home chocolate fountains are particularly
        problematic (it is a so-called non Newtonian fluid[1]), since the
        gravitational forces are much lower than the viscous forces; this means
        that small chocolate fountains need a very high proportion of vegetable
        oil. There is a trade-off between looks and taste: if perfect smooth
        flow may be sacrificed, it's possible to use non-oily chocolate.
      </p>
      <p>
        A cheaper alternative to couverture chocolate is chocolate-flavored
        syrup, also called "chocolate coating". Chocolate coating is already in
        liquid form and costs much less than couverture chocolate, though some
        connoisseurs prefer gourmet Belgian couverture despite the added
        expense. Another alternative is to use dark chocolate, such as 70% cocoa
        chocolate. This contains much less sugar, so it isn't so sticky; a small
        quantity of hot water may be added to thin it further.

      <h2>Increasing popularity</h2>
      <p>
        Originally, the market was entirely commercial, with chocolate fountains
        costing a large amount of money and requiring significant upkeep. The
        popularity of chocolate fountains grew to a point of demand at a
        consumer retail level as people who had seen commercial models at
        catered events inquired about purchasing their own fountains. Then, at
        the end of 2004, the Hellmann Group began marketing the Nostalgia
        Chocolate Fountain for personal use.
      </p>
      <p>
        This expansion into the retail market caused the demand to peak
        drastically. As a result, the catering industry saw more requests for
        chocolate fountains at events. Flavoring oils such as mint, orange, and
        cappuccino were developed to give the chocolate extra taste. Caterers
        began adding food coloring to white chocolate to make it coincide with
        special holidays or events. Caterers and home users created special
        recipes for a variety of fondues that would flow well in a fountain;
        some of the more popular recipes included caramel, cheese, maple syrup,
        ranch dressing, and BBQ sauce. Because of the growing practice of using
        chocolate fountains for other types of fondue, chocolate fountains
        became interchangeably referred to as "fondue fountains".
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, commercial chocolate fountains are a common fixture at well-to-do
        galas, weddings, and catered parties; while home chocolate fountains are
        more commonly seen at birthday parties and friendly gatherings. New
        models often incorporate more than one flavour of chocolate and a 'cup'
        design in place of the traditional tiered models. These models are
        designed to cater to new customer desires, to decrease the amount of
        chocolate needed and chocolate wastage.

        The Jean-Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio Casino in Paradise, Nevada
        is home to the world's tallest chocolate fountain.
